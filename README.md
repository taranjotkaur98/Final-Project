# Final-Project
DESCRIPTION:
I have used Round robin scheduling in my code. I have created one Faculty and one Student process. My code is for handling of 
Queries of Student. Multiple queries are being handled at a given time. Separate request queues for both Faculty and Student are 
made; where Faculty is given higher priority as compared to the studentâ€™s request. The system asks for arrival time and the burst 
time for a request followed by time quanta for each request. After that it calculates the turnaround time and waiting time for each 
request individually and at the end it returns average waiting time and turnaround time for all the requests.
